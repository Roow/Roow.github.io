        <p>I am a recent Graduate Mechatronics Engineer. I enjoy working with electronics, software, and everything in between.</p>

        <p>During my degree, I spent most time outside of classes being involved with <a href="https://www.monashmotorsport.com/" target="_blank">Monash Motorsport</a>, 
             where I designed and developed custom PCBs and electrical systems. Before that, I was a Student Test Engineer at <a href="https://www.bosch.com.au/" target="_blank">Bosch</a>, 
            writing test scripts and testing automotive products.</p>
        
        <p>I learn the most when I tinker with things. My most recent project is the design of a <b>traction inverter</b> for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_SAE" target="_blank">
          Formula SAE</a> electric vehicle. This is the most challenging project I have worked on, involving power electronics, control systems and high-speed layout.
        </p>

        <p>Apart from being an Engineer, I am also a home barista, home cook, a motorsport enthusiat and an unprofitable Poker player</p>
