      <h3 class="project-title">Custom SiC traction inverter</h3>
      <div class="project-description">
        <p>For the final year project of my honours degree, I designed a <a href="/assets/files/FYP.pdf" target="_blank">Custom SiC Traction Inverter</a> with my project partner. The <b>120kW</b> traction inverter
          is a key component of the electric powertrain on our FSAE vehicle, enabling precise <b>power and torque distribution</b> to the 4 individual motors.</p>
          
        <p>This project is by far the most difficult that I've attempted, it challenged me to acquire extensive knowledge on <b>power electronics</b>, <b>multilayer PCB layout</b>, <b>circuit simulation</b>
          and so much more. </p>

      <h3 class="project-title">Co-founding a computer business</h3>
      <div class="project-description">
        <p>In 2020, I started a business selling computers with my friend, we called it 
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/carpiocomputers/" target="_blank">Carpio Computers</a>. The business model was simple, we sourced off-the-shelf components
          from various sources at lower than market rate, built desktop PCs with a strong focus on <b>quality and aesthetics</b>, then sold them at prices much lower than what major retailers
          were selling for. </p>

        <p>Despite accumulating over 30 customers, making <b>tens of thousands of dollars in revenue</b>, the value of the company was much more in <b>providing learning opportunity</b>
          than in making a profit. We ceased operations about a year and a half later.</p>

      <h3 class="project-title">This Website!</h3>
      <div class="project-description">
        <p>I wanted a personal portfolio website to showcase my past work and projects, so I learnt how to build one.</p>
        <p>I built this website with Jekyll, HTML, SCSS and JS, and it is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/Roow/Roow.github.io" target="_blank">Github pages</a>.</p>
